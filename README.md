# Tech-Studio-DRONER-2.0
A TECH. STUDIO PROJECT BY NICO ABAIS & VLADAN MUTABDZIJA

Droner 2.0 is an interactive game in which a player gets an instruction which calls for an action to be performed. The instruction is triggered by the button(s) on the control interface and is delivered via a hologram of a person's head (the game master). A list of predetermined action words is defined in the program and randomized each time it's triggered. It can include up to three combinations (arrays) of words.  Every command given by game master is a pre-recorded video clip, in which the game master speaks the command. Video clips are stored on the local drive and are linked to the action words. 
In cases where the combination of words is used, the video clips are played sequentially and due to the video clips being recorded separately for each command, the sequential action will thus seem robotic.
